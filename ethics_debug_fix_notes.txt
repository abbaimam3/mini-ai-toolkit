AI Tools Assignment — Debugging & Fix NotesTASK 2 (TensorFlow CNN – MNIST)---❌ ISSUE: NameError: name 'model' is not defined  💡 FIX: Defined the CNN model architecture before evaluation step.- Added:model = Sequential([...])- Then re-ran:model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)❌ ISSUE: Model saving warning — "HDF5 file format is considered legacy"💡 FIX: Updated model saving method to Keras native format:model.save('mnist_digit_classifier.keras')❌ ISSUE: Tensor shape mismatch during model training💡 FIX: Verified input data shape using:X_train.shapeand normalized to (num_samples, 28, 28, 1).✅ FINAL STATUS:- Model successfully trained with >97% test accuracy.- Visualization generated for 5 sample predictions.TASK 1 (Scikit-learn Decision Tree – Iris)---❌ ISSUE: Class label encoding mismatch💡 FIX: Applied LabelEncoder() before model fitting.❌ ISSUE: Model underfitting💡 FIX: Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV for 'max_depth' and 'criterion'.✅ FINAL STATUS:- Accuracy improved to ~96%.- Confusion matrix and classification report generated successfully.TASK 3 (spaCy NLP – Amazon Reviews)---❌ ISSUE: Missing language model error (en_core_web_sm)💡 FIX: Installed using:python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm❌ ISSUE: Sentiment polarity not reflecting reality for neutral text💡 FIX: Added a rule-based check:- If polarity between -0.1 and 0.1 → "Neutral"✅ FINAL STATUS:- Entities and sentiment correctly extracted.- Data visualizations created using Matplotlib.GENERAL FIXES---Ensured all notebooks include comments and Markdown explanations.Added random_state=42 to ensure reproducibility.Verified all CSV file paths are relative for portability.Confirmed compatibility across TensorFlow 2.15, scikit-learn 1.5, and spaCy 3.7.SUMMARY:All three models functioned correctly after debugging.Each script runs smoothly in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook with dependencies listed in requirements.txt.Last updated: November 2025Author: Abba ImamProject: Mini AI Toolkit (Week 3 Assignment)
