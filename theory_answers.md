# 🎯 AI Tools Assignment — Part 1: Theoretical Understanding  **Theme:** Mastering the AI Toolkit  **Group Members:** [Add Names Here]  **Course:** Artificial Intelligence Tools and Applications  ---## **Q1. Explain the primary differences between TensorFlow and PyTorch. When would you choose one over the other?**| Aspect | **TensorFlow** | **PyTorch** ||--------|----------------|-------------|| **Computation Graph** | Uses a static computation graph (TensorFlow 1.x) and later introduced eager execution for flexibility. | Uses a dynamic computation graph that builds at runtime, making debugging intuitive. || **Ease of Use** | Requires more boilerplate but offers powerful production support (TF-Serving, TFX). | Easier for experimentation and research; Pythonic and more flexible for custom models. || **Deployment** | Strong ecosystem for deployment — TensorFlow Lite, TensorFlow.js, and TensorFlow Serving. | Deployment tools improving (TorchServe, TorchScript), but less mature than TensorFlow’s. || **Visualization** | TensorBoard offers advanced visualization tools for metrics and model graphs. | Offers TensorBoard integration but less native visualization. || **Preferred Scenario** | When scalability and deployment matter (e.g., large-scale production). | When prototyping and research flexibility matter (e.g., fast experimentation). |**Conclusion:**  Choose **TensorFlow** for production and mobile deployment; choose **PyTorch** for quick research, experimentation, and academic use.---## **Q2. Describe two use cases for Jupyter Notebooks in AI development.**1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**     Jupyter allows interactive visualization and code execution, making it ideal for data cleaning, feature engineering, and plotting results step-by-step.2. **Model Prototyping & Documentation:**     Researchers use Jupyter to build, test, and share models interactively with inline visualizations and markdown explanations for reproducibility.---## **Q3. How does spaCy enhance NLP tasks compared to basic Python string operations?**| Feature | **spaCy** | **Basic String Operations** ||----------|------------|-----------------------------|| **Language Models** | Pre-trained statistical models for POS tagging, dependency parsing, and NER. | Limited to exact matches and simple substring operations. || **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** | Identifies entities like names, organizations, and dates automatically. | Requires manual regex patterns and lacks context awareness. || **Tokenization & Lemmatization** | Linguistically accurate tokenization and lemmatization. | Rudimentary splitting (e.g., `.split()`), ignores linguistic context. || **Efficiency** | Built in Cython for high performance. | Pure Python — slower and less scalable. |**In essence:**  spaCy provides **context-aware**, **statistically driven**, and **efficient NLP pipelines** that go far beyond basic string manipulation.---## **Q4. Comparative Analysis: Scikit-learn vs TensorFlow**| Criteria | **Scikit-learn** | **TensorFlow** ||-----------|------------------|----------------|| **Target Applications** | Classical ML (e.g., regression, decision trees, clustering). | Deep learning (e.g., CNNs, RNNs, transformers). || **Ease of Use** | Simple, beginner-friendly, and consistent API. | Steeper learning curve; powerful for large-scale neural networks. || **Performance** | Best for small to medium datasets. | Optimized for GPU/TPU training and large-scale data. || **Community Support** | Extensive documentation and support in academia. | Massive industry support from Google and open-source developers. || **Integration** | Works well with pandas, NumPy, and joblib. | Works with Keras, TFX, and TensorFlow Hub. |**Summary:**  Use **Scikit-learn** for fast, interpretable ML tasks. Use **TensorFlow** for advanced, large-scale deep learning systems.---🧾 **End of Theory Section**
